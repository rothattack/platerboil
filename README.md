# platerboil
A project starter for HTML5 applications driven by Gulp.

The following are the major technologies involved in this stack:
1. HTML5 Boilerplate
2. SASS
3. jQuery
4. Angular

To begin, install node modules:
```bash
npm install
```

And then install bower dependencies:
```bash
bower install
```

As of now, just run to develop:
```bash
gulp
```

__What's ahead?__

1. Adding Bootstrap SCSS files.
2. Compiling source to a production friendly build.
